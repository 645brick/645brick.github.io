<h1>645 the dream</h1>

<p>
	It started with a want to shoot at night, lowestest of low light and not a sacrifice in degrading iso and digital noise from a sensor.
</p>
<p>	I had an idea to use an off the shelf speed booster/focal reducer to gain a few stops and get 	back what the eye can see but what most cameras are unable to capture.
	Not one had a suitable design for the lenses of old.
</p>
<p>
	The 6x4.5 the 6x6 the 6x7 the greats of the film age.
</p>
<p>
	What full frame strives to be.
</p>
<p>
	Medium format
</p>
<p>
	The ideal size for digital.
</p>
<p>
	The issue arose that whilst great lenses all that is avalible is adapters. so you get an insane crop value if used with the mirror system cameras of today.
</p>
<p>	
	Back focal lengths that are more than enough for the frame sizes that medium format held dear.
